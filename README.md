# Arduino RFID Driver

[Documentation.pdf](Documentation.pdf)

## Dependency
This project depends on my other library called: ArduinoDevice (https://github.com/dalmirdasilva/ArduinoDevice). First, you need to clone that repo, go into his folder and execute ```make install```. Installing libraries (On Linux) is basically linking them into ```~/Arduino/libraries```. On Window you will have to copy and past the files to the correct destination - which I don't know!
